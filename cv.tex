\section{About me}
\cvitem{}{
	I am a problem solver at heart and and seeing suboptimal solutions to problems which have better solutions immediately available easily distract me -- or at worst annoys me.
	However, especially when considering programming problems I find it is important to not strife for perfection but rather consider continuous usefulness improvements.
	This balance is the crux of project management as I see it, and I enjoy being on either side of that discussion.
	\newline I love learning new tidbits of knowledge in many different fields.
	Whether picking up guitar chords or acquiring programming knowledge, the simple act of improving overall knowledge is fulfilling to me.
	This makes me less of a specialist and more of a jack-of-all-trades, but I consider that a strength in most situations when interacting with different people from different fields.
	\newline I enjoy people and spend quite a lot of time socialising -- preferably over board games with a gin and tonic in hand.
